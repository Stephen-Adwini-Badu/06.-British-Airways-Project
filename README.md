# British Airways Project Notebook

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification model to predict customer behavior, specifically distinguishing between customers who successfully book flights and those who cancel. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the project aims to improve decision-making and enhance customer retention strategies for British Airways.

## Methodology
1. **Importing Libraries**
   - Utilized essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed data to understand customer booking patterns.
   - Investigated missing values, data distributions, and correlations.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Created visualizations to identify trends and relationships.
   - Plotted charts including histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Balanced imbalanced datasets to ensure model fairness.
   - Split data into training, validation, and testing datasets.

5. **Model Development**
   - Implemented multiple classifiers including decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods.
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to improve performance.
   
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Validated models using precision, recall, F1 scores, and confusion matrices.
   - Compared multiple classifiers and identified the best-performing model.
